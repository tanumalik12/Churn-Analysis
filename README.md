**Purpose of Churn Analysis:**

Churn analysis aims to understand why customers leave a service or product and identify factors influencing customer retention. By analyzing churn, businesses can take proactive measures to reduce customer attrition, improve customer satisfaction, and increase profitability.

In the Colab Notebook, I'll provide explanations for each step of the churn analysis, including data loading, cleaning, churn rate calculation, feature analysis, and visualization. We'll also summarize insights gained from the analysis regarding factors influencing customer retention and provide recommendations for reducing churn based on these insights.
